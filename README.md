# Remove Duolingo Ads

A simple Chromium extension that removes advertisments and offers from Duolingo. 
You can still view the ads and offers by clicking the extension icon and click "Show Ads".

### Usage
This extension is not the Chrome Web Store so you need to download it and load it manually from the [Extensions Page](chrome://extensions) with Developer mode.

If any ad is not being removed, [open an issue](https://github.com/humanfriend22/remove-duolingo-ads/issues)
